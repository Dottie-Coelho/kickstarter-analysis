# Kickstarting with Excel by Dottie Coelho

## Overview of Project

This project used data collected from Kickstarter to compare how different campaigns progressed in releation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose

The purpsose of this project was to help Louise evaulate data of campaigns based on when they were launched on the monitary goals. 
 
## Analysis and Challenges

First, she wanted to see how many theater campaigns were either successful, failed or cancelled based on their launch date. The chart labled "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" gives you a visual reference of the collected data. She then wanted to see the campaign outcomes based on financial goals. The chart labled "Outcomes Based on Goal" shows a visial representation of this data. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

When we review Outcomes Based on Launch Date, we can see the the most successful campaigns were launched in May and June. May and July had the most failed campains. January had the most canceled campaigns. Our highest total campaigns were launched in May. May was the busiest month with 111 successful campaigns, 52 failed campaigns, and 3 cancelled campaigns. This equals a total of 166 total campaigns launched in May, for a 67% success rate. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Reviewing our Analusis of Outcomes Based on Goals, shows that the most successful campaigns had a goal of $1,000 to $4,999. There were 388 successfull plays and 146 failed plays. The success rate was 73%. Campaigns with a goal of $45,000 to $49,999 were the least popular. There were 0 successful plays and 1 failed play at this goal amount, for a 0% success rate. Goals less the $1,000 had a 76% success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

May is the best month to launch campaigns based on data analized in Outcomes Based on Launch Date. Based on this information, it shows that December is the worst month to launch campaigns. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

When reviewing Outcomes based on Goals, we can see that goals less than $1,000 were the most successful with a 76% success rate. Goals between $1,000 to $4,999 had the most success, with 388 successful campaigns. Goals between $45,000-$49,999 were the least popular and had the highest failure rate, with only 1 failed campaign. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some of the limitations of this dataset is that we are not looking at the pledged amount received from these campains. So even if the campain earned money, it was considered a failed campaign. Another problem is that some campaigns earned more than their goal, but were canceled. Those campaigns could be successful in the future. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create tables or graphs to show the success, failure or cancel rate for other catergories included in the kickstarter dataset.
